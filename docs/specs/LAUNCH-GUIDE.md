# üöÄ Morph Commerce - Complete Launch Guide

## ‚ö° Quick Launch (5 Commands)

```bash
# 1. Check deployment readiness
node scripts/verify-deployment.cjs

# 2. Get Morph Holesky ETH from https://faucet.morphl2.io
# Then deploy contracts:
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.cjs --network morphHolesky

# 3. Update frontend with contract addresses
node scripts/post-deploy.cjs

# 4. Test the complete flow
npx hardhat run scripts/test-flow.cjs --network morphHolesky

# 5. Deploy to Vercel
npm run build
# Upload dist/ folder to vercel.com or use: npx vercel --prod
```

## üìã Remaining Critical Tasks

### ‚òê Get Morph Holesky ETH from faucet
- **URL**: https://faucet.morphl2.io
- **Need**: ~0.1 ETH for deployment gas
- **Verify**: `node scripts/check-wallet.cjs`

### ‚òê Deploy MockUSDC.sol contract to Morph Holesky
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.cjs --network morphHolesky
```
- Deploys all 3 contracts in sequence
- Sets up proper permissions automatically
- Creates `deployments.json` with addresses

### ‚òê Fund test wallets with MockUSDC
- Use admin panel: `/admin` ‚Üí "Claim Test USDC"
- Or call faucet function directly
- Fund 2-3 wallets with 50-100 USDC each

### ‚òê Deploy all contracts to Morph Holesky and verify
```bash
# After deployment, verify on explorer
# Visit: https://explorer-holesky.morphl2.io
# Search for your contract addresses
```

### ‚òê Test complete user flow
1. **Start frontend**: `npm run dev`
2. **Connect wallet** to Morph Holesky
3. **Get USDC** via admin panel
4. **Buy item** from shop (test approval flow)
5. **Check loyalty** badges in `/loyalty`
6. **Test admin** badge minting

### ‚òê Conduct final end-to-end testing
- **Desktop + Mobile** testing
- **Error scenarios**: insufficient balance, wrong network
- **Performance**: transaction speed emphasis
- **Demo rehearsal**: practice 3-minute pitch

### ‚òê Deploy frontend to Vercel
```bash
# Method 1: Manual upload
npm run build
# Upload dist/ folder at vercel.com

# Method 2: Vercel CLI
npx vercel --prod

# Method 3: GitHub integration
# Connect repo to Vercel dashboard
```

## üß™ Testing Commands

```bash
# Check wallet balance
node scripts/check-wallet.cjs

# Test deployed contracts
npx hardhat run scripts/test-flow.cjs --network morphHolesky

# Verify deployment status
node scripts/verify-deployment.cjs

# Test local build
npm run build && npm run preview
```
