## üé§ **SCENE 1: Hook & Problem (0:00 - 0:30)**

**[VISUAL: KudoBit logo on screen, clean background]**

**SCRIPT:**
> "Hi, I'm [Your Name] from Team KudoBit. We're building the **Web3 Gumroad** on Morph - a platform that finally gives creators true sovereignty and fans real ownership.
>
> Today's creator platforms like Gumroad extract **10% fees**, risk **censoring creators**, and give fans worthless loyalty points they don't actually own. 
>
> What if we could fix all of this with blockchain technology?"

**[VISUAL TRANSITION: Problem slide showing Web2 platform issues]**

## üé§ **SCENE 2: Solution Overview (0:30 - 1:00)**

**[VISUAL: KudoBit solution diagram]**

**SCRIPT:**
> "KudoBit solves these problems using **Morph's unique blockchain advantages**.
>
> **For Creators:** Direct wallet payouts with **sub-$0.01 transaction costs** - making even **5-cent digital stickers profitable** for the first time.
>
> **For Fans:** True digital ownership through **ERC-1155 NFT badges** stored in their wallets, not just database points.
>
> **Why Morph?** Only Morph's **decentralized sequencer** and **hybrid rollup** make this economically viable at scale."

**SCRIPT:**
> "Let me show you KudoBit in action. This is our creator's digital storefront."

**[ACTION: Connect wallet]**
> "First, I connect my wallet - notice there's **no password needed**. This is wallet-based authentication using **Sign-in with Ethereum**."

**[VISUAL: MetaMask connection prompt]**
> "You own your identity, not the platform."

**[ACTION: Show products]**
> "Here are digital products at **micro-prices** - a 5-cent sticker, 20-cent wallpaper. These prices are only profitable because of **Morph's ultra-low fees**."

**[ACTION: Get MockUSDC from faucet]**
> "I'll grab some test USDC from our integrated faucet..."

**[ACTION: Purchase the sticker]**
> "Now I'll buy this 5-cent digital sticker. Watch the transaction speed..."

**[VISUAL: MetaMask approve + purchase prompts]**
> "Two quick MetaMask prompts - approval and purchase. Notice the **instant confirmation** - that's Morph's hybrid rollup technology providing **sub-second finality**."

**[VISUAL: Success notification]**

**SCRIPT:**
> "Now let me switch to the creator's perspective. In our admin panel, I can see earnings and manage loyalty rewards."

**[ACTION: Award loyalty badge]**
> "For this demo, I'll manually award a loyalty badge. In production, this would happen automatically after purchase."

**[VISUAL: Badge minting transaction]**
> "I'm minting an **ERC-1155 NFT badge** directly to the fan's wallet. This isn't just a database entry - it's a **real digital asset** they own forever."

**[ACTION: Switch to loyalty dashboard]**
> "And here's the fan's loyalty dashboard showing their earned badge."

**[VISUAL: Badge gallery with owned badge]**
> "This badge is **verifiable on the blockchain**, can't be taken away by any platform, and will enable **cross-creator benefits** in the future."

**[ACTION: Click 'View on Morphscan']**
> "You can verify ownership on Morphscan - this is **true digital ownership**."

### **Demo Part 3: Technical Innovation (3:00 - 3:30)**

> - **IPFS integration** for decentralized metadata storage  
> - **Hono.js backend** with **Sign-in with Ethereum** authentication
> - **React frontend** with modern Web3 tooling
>
