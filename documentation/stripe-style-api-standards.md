# ‚úÖ Stripe-Style API Standards (Complete Blueprint)

This document provides a comprehensive blueprint for designing modern, maintainable, and developer-friendly APIs, inspired by Stripe's world-class API practices.

-----

## 1\. RESTful Design

Stripe strictly adheres to REST principles:

  - **Resources are nouns** (not verbs): `/customers`, `/charges`, `/payments`
  - **HTTP Methods**:
      - `GET`: Retrieve data
      - `POST`: Create new data
      - `PATCH`: Update partial data
      - `DELETE`: Remove data

### üìò Examples:

| Method | Endpoint             | Action               |
|--------|----------------------|----------------------|
| GET    | /v1/customers        | List all customers   |
| POST   | /v1/customers        | Create new customer  |
| GET    | /v1/customers/:id    | Retrieve a customer  |
| PATCH  | /v1/customers/:id    | Update a customer    |
| DELETE | /v1/customers/:id    | Delete a customer    |

-----

## 2\. Consistent Resource Structure

Every object returned by the API has a consistent shape:

```json
{
  "id": "cus_abc123",
  "object": "customer",
  "email": "jane@example.com",
  "name": "Jane Doe",
  "created": 1720000000
}
```

### ‚úÖ Best Practices:

  - Always include:
      - `id`: Unique identifier
      - `object`: Type of the resource
      - `created`: UNIX timestamp
  - Nest related resources using sub-objects or IDs
  - Use pagination fields like `limit`, `starting_after`, and `has_more`
  - **Consistent Naming Conventions**: Use `snake_case` for JSON field names and `camelCase` for query parameters to maintain consistency.

-----

## 3\. Architecture: Router ‚Üí Controller ‚Üí Service ‚Üí Model

A clean, layered architecture improves testability and separation of concerns.

### üß≠ Router

Defines API routes and forwards requests.

```js
// routes/customerRoutes.js
router.get('/customers/:id', customerController.getCustomer);
```

### üß† Controller

Handles HTTP logic: input validation, formatting the response.

```js
// controllers/customerController.js
exports.getCustomer = async (req, res, next) => {
  try {
    const customer = await customerService.getCustomerById(req.params.id);
    res.json(customer);
  } catch (err) {
    next(err);
  }
};
```

### üîß Service

Handles business logic and domain rules.

```js
// services/customerService.js
exports.getCustomerById = async (id) => {
  return await customerModel.findById(id);
};
```

### üóÑ Model

Manages the actual data layer (SQL, NoSQL, etc.).

```js
// models/customerModel.js
exports.findById = async (id) => {
  return db.customers.find(c => c.id === id);
};
```

-----

## 4\. Versioning

APIs should include versioning in the URL:

```http
GET /v1/customers/:id
```

### üìå Why?

  - Allows for backward-compatible changes
  - Prevents breaking existing clients
  - **Deprecation Strategy**: Clearly communicate when older API versions will be deprecated and eventually removed, providing ample transition time.

-----

## 5\. Error Handling Format

Always return structured error responses:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "type": "validation_error",
    "message": "Email is required",
    "code": "missing_parameter",
    "param": "email"
  }
}
```

### ‚úÖ Best Practices:

  - Use clear `type` values:
      - `validation_error`
      - `authentication_error`
      - `authorization_error` (distinct from authentication)
      - `api_error`
      - `rate_limit_exceeded`
      - `not_found`
  - Always include a user-readable `message`
  - Consider adding `code` for programmatic error handling and `param` for validation errors.
  - Use correct HTTP status codes (400, 401, 403, 404, 429, 500)

-----

## 6\. Pagination, Filtering, and Sorting

Use **cursor-based pagination** to manage large datasets:

```http
GET /v1/customers?limit=10&starting_after=cus_abc123
```

### ‚úÖ Response Example:

```json
{
  "data": [/* array of customers */],
  "has_more": true
}
```

### üîé Filtering and Sorting (New Detail):

  - **Filtering**: Allow clients to filter collections using query parameters (e.g., `/customers?status=active`).
  - **Sorting**: Support sorting on common fields using query parameters (e.g., `/customers?sort_by=created_at&order=desc`).
  - **Field Selection (Partial Responses)**: Allow clients to request only specific fields to reduce payload size (e.g., `/customers/:id?fields=id,email`).

-----

## 7\. Webhooks (Optional)

Webhooks notify external systems of events (e.g., payment success):

```json
{
  "id": "evt_123",
  "type": "payment_succeeded",
  "data": {
    "object": {
      "id": "pi_abc",
      "amount": 1000
    }
  }
}
```

### ‚úÖ Best Practices:

  - **Sign Webhook Payloads**: Include a signature in the headers to allow recipients to verify the authenticity and integrity of the webhook event.
  - **Implement Retry Mechanisms**: Webhook delivery should have built-in retry logic for temporary failures with exponential backoff.
  - **Provide Event IDs**: Unique IDs for each event to prevent duplicate processing.
  - **Event Sequencing**: Ensure that events related to the same object are delivered in the correct order.
  - **Webhook Dashboard**: Provide tools for users to view delivery attempts, inspect payloads, and manually retry failed deliveries.

-----

## 8\. Authentication & Authorization

Use **Bearer tokens** in the `Authorization` header:

```http
Authorization: Bearer sk_test_abc123
```

### ‚úÖ Best Practices for Authentication:

  - **Require tokens for all endpoints** unless explicitly public (e.g., health checks).
  - Validate tokens in **middleware** before reaching the controller.
  - **OAuth 2.0**: For third-party integrations, implement standard OAuth 2.0 flows (e.g., Authorization Code Grant for web apps, Client Credentials for machine-to-machine).
  - **Token Expiration and Rotation**: Implement short-lived access tokens and longer-lived refresh tokens. Ensure a mechanism for secure token rotation and revocation.
  - **Secure Token Storage**: Advise clients on secure storage practices for API keys and tokens (e.g., environment variables, secure vaults, not hardcoding in client-side code).
  - **API Key Management**: Provide a dashboard for users to generate, revoke, and manage their API keys. Differentiate between publishable (client-side safe) and secret keys.

### üîê Authorization:

Beyond authentication, ensure the authenticated user has the necessary permissions.

  - **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Assign roles to users (e.g., `admin`, `viewer`, `developer`) and define permissions based on these roles.
  - **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**: For more granular control, define permissions based on attributes of the user, the resource, or the environment (e.g., "only allow access to `customer` objects owned by the requesting `user_id`").
  - **Least Privilege Principle**: Grant only the minimum necessary permissions to users and applications.
  - **Policy Enforcement**: Implement authorization logic in a dedicated layer, typically within the **Service** layer or a specific authorization middleware.

-----

## 9\. Rate Limiting & Idempotency (Advanced)

### üß† To Prevent Duplicates (Idempotency):

Use `Idempotency-Key` in headers:

```http
Idempotency-Key: abc123
```

  - **Idempotency Key Scope**: Ensure the idempotency key is tied to the requesting user/client and the specific operation.

### üîê Rate Limiting:

  - Use HTTP `429 Too Many Requests` if too many requests are made.
  - Provide a `Retry-After` header when appropriate, indicating how long the client should wait before making another request.
  - Implement different rate limits for different API endpoints or user tiers.
  - Use headers to communicate rate limit status:
      - `X-RateLimit-Limit`: The total number of requests allowed in the current window.
      - `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: The number of requests remaining in the current window.
      - `X-RateLimit-Reset`: The time at which the current rate limit window resets (e.g., UNIX timestamp).
  - **Burst vs. Sustained Limits**: Consider allowing short bursts of traffic above the sustained rate limit.

-----

## 10\. Security Best Practices

Beyond authentication and authorization, several other security measures are crucial.

### ‚úÖ Input Validation & Sanitization:

  - **Validate All Inputs**: Ensure all incoming data (query parameters, path parameters, request bodies) conforms to expected types, formats, and constraints. Reject malformed requests early.
  - **Sanitize Inputs**: Prevent injection attacks (SQL injection, XSS, command injection, NoSQL injection) by sanitizing user-supplied data before processing or storing it. Use parameterized queries for database interactions.

### üîí Data Encryption:

  - **Encryption in Transit (TLS/SSL)**: All API communication **must** use HTTPS to protect data from eavesdropping and tampering. Enforce TLS 1.2+ and strong cipher suites.
  - **Encryption at Rest**: Encrypt sensitive data (e.g., PII, payment information) when stored in databases, file systems, or backups.

### üõ°Ô∏è Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS):

  - **Restrict Origins**: Configure CORS policies to only allow requests from trusted domains. Avoid using `*` (wildcard) for origins in production.
  - **Specify Allowed Methods and Headers**: Limit permitted HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.) and headers.

### üö´ Secure Headers:

  - Implement security-related HTTP response headers:
      - `Content-Security-Policy (CSP)`: Mitigate XSS attacks by controlling which resources the user agent is allowed to load.
      - `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`: Prevent MIME-sniffing vulnerabilities.
      - `X-Frame-Options: DENY`: Prevent clickjacking by disallowing embedding in iframes.
      - `Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)`: Enforce HTTPS-only communication by instructing browsers to always use HTTPS for future requests.
      - `Referrer-Policy`: Control the `Referer` header to protect user privacy.

### üíâ API Gateway / WAF:

  - Consider using an API Gateway or Web Application Firewall (WAF) to provide an additional layer of security, including:
      - DDoS protection
      - Threat detection and blocking of common attack patterns (e.g., SQLi, XSS).
      - API abuse prevention.
      - Centralized rate limiting and authentication.

### üîë Secret Management:

  - Never hardcode API keys, database credentials, or other sensitive information directly in code.
  - Use secure secret management systems (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, Azure Key Vault, Kubernetes Secrets) for storing and retrieving secrets at runtime.

### üõ°Ô∏è OWASP API Security Top 10 (New Detail):

  - Actively review and mitigate risks identified in the [OWASP API Security Top 10](https://owasp.org/API-Security/):
    1.  Broken Object Level Authorization
    2.  Broken User Authentication
    3.  Excessive Data Exposure
    4.  Lack of Resources & Rate Limiting
    5.  Broken Function Level Authorization
    6.  Mass Assignment
    7.  Security Misconfiguration
    8.  Injection
    9.  Improper Inventory Management
    10. Unsafe Consumption of APIs

### üîÑ Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:

  - Conduct regular security audits, vulnerability scans, and penetration tests to identify and remediate weaknesses.
  - Implement a bug bounty program to leverage external security researchers.

### üßë‚Äçüíª Secure Coding Practices:

  - Train developers on secure coding principles and common API vulnerabilities.
  - Perform code reviews with a security focus.

-----

## 11\. Logging, Monitoring, and Observability

Comprehensive logging, monitoring, and observability are essential for debugging, auditing, security, and performance.

### üìä Structured Logging:

  - **Format Logs as JSON**: Makes logs easily parseable by logging systems and tools.
  - **Include Key Information**:
      - `timestamp`: UTC timestamp of the log event.
      - `level`: Log severity (e.g., `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`).
      - `message`: A concise description of the event.
      - `correlation_id`: A unique ID for each incoming request, passed through all services, to trace a full request flow across distributed systems.
      - `user_id` (if authenticated): Identifier of the user making the request.
      - `request_id`: Unique identifier for the HTTP request.
      - `endpoint`: The API endpoint accessed (e.g., `/v1/customers/:id`).
      - `method`: HTTP method (e.g., `GET`, `POST`).
      - `status_code`: HTTP response status code.
      - `latency`: Time taken to process the request.
      - `error_type` / `error_details` (for errors): Stack traces, specific error messages, and context.
      - `client_ip`: IP address of the client making the request.
      - `user_agent`: User-Agent string from the client.
      - Relevant business context (e.g., `customer_id`, `payment_id`).

### üìà Log Levels:

  - Use appropriate log levels to filter and manage log volume.
      - **DEBUG**: Detailed information for debugging during development.
      - **INFO**: General operational information (e.g., request received, successful operation).
      - **WARN**: Potential issues that don't prevent functionality but should be investigated (e.g., deprecated API usage, unexpected but handled input).
      - **ERROR**: Errors that disrupt functionality but can be recovered from (e.g., failed external service call).
      - **CRITICAL**: Severe errors leading to system failure or data corruption (e.g., database connection lost).

### üîç Centralized Log Management:

  - **Aggregate Logs**: Send all logs from various services to a centralized logging system (e.g., ELK Stack, Splunk, Datadog, Sumo Logic, Grafana Loki).
  - **Search and Analysis**: Utilize centralized logging for efficient searching, filtering, correlation, and analysis of logs.

### üö® Alerting:

  - Set up automated alerts for critical events:
      - High error rates (e.g., 4xx/5xx errors exceeding a threshold).
      - Security events (e.g., repeated failed authentication attempts, suspicious IP activity, API key compromise detection).
      - Performance degradation (e.g., increased latency, low throughput).
      - Specific business logic failures or anomalies.
      - Resource exhaustion (CPU, memory, disk).

### üìñ Audit Logs:

  - Maintain detailed audit logs for actions that modify data, create/delete resources, or have significant security implications (e.g., user creation, data deletion, permission changes, login/logout).
  - **What to Log**: Who performed the action, what action was performed, when it was performed (timestamp), the outcome (success/failure), and relevant identifiers (e.g., resource ID, user ID).
  - **Non-Repudiation**: Ensure audit logs are tamper-proof, immutable, and retained for compliance and forensic analysis.

### üíæ Log Retention:

  - Define clear policies for log retention based on compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS) and operational troubleshooting needs. Differentiate retention for various log types (e.g., audit logs vs. debug logs).

### üìä Metrics and Dashboards (New Detail):

  - **Collect Metrics**: Gather key performance indicators (KPIs) like request volume, latency per endpoint, error rates, CPU/memory usage.
  - **Visualization**: Use dashboards (e.g., Grafana, Datadog, Kibana) to visualize metrics in real-time, helping identify trends and anomalies.
  - **Business Metrics**: Track metrics relevant to business operations (e.g., successful payments, new customer sign-ups via API).

### üåê Distributed Tracing (New Detail):

  - **Trace Requests**: Implement distributed tracing (e.g., OpenTelemetry, Jaeger, Zipkin) to visualize the flow of a single request across multiple services. This is invaluable for debugging microservices architectures.
  - **Span Context**: Propagate trace and span IDs through all service calls.

-----

## 12\. Documentation (New Detail)

Comprehensive and up-to-date documentation is paramount for developer adoption and usability.

### ‚úÖ Best Practices:

  - **Interactive API Reference**: Provide interactive documentation (e.g., using OpenAPI/Swagger UI) that allows developers to try out API calls directly in the browser.
  - **Clear Examples**: Include clear, real-world examples for all endpoints, including request bodies, response payloads, and common error scenarios.
  - **Code Snippets**: Offer code snippets in multiple popular programming languages (e.g., cURL, Python, Node.js, Ruby, PHP).
  - **Getting Started Guide**: A step-by-step guide for new developers to make their first API call.
  - **Authentication & Error Guides**: Dedicated sections explaining how to authenticate and handle various error types.
  - **Versioning and Deprecation Policy**: Clearly outline the API versioning strategy and deprecation timelines.
  - **Change Log/Release Notes**: Maintain a public record of all API changes, new features, bug fixes, and deprecations.

-----

## 13\. Testing Strategy (New Detail)

A robust testing strategy ensures API quality, reliability, and security.

### ‚úÖ Types of Testing:

  - **Unit Tests**: Test individual components (models, services, controllers) in isolation.
  - **Integration Tests**: Verify that different components or services interact correctly.
  - **End-to-End Tests**: Simulate real-user scenarios to ensure the entire system works as expected.
  - **Contract Testing**: Ensure that different services adhere to their API contracts, especially in a microservices environment.
  - **Performance Testing**: Assess API performance under various load conditions (load testing, stress testing).
  - **Security Testing**: Include vulnerability scanning, penetration testing, and fuzz testing.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Automation:

  - Integrate tests into your Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline.
  - Automate API testing using tools like Postman, Newman, or dedicated API testing frameworks.
